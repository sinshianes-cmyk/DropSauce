## About this fork

### DropSauce 0.9.8 – Change Log

#### Look & feel
- **Frosted list/grid items**: new `bg_frosted_item` drawable (88% surface colour, 1dp outline, ripple) applied to `item_manga_list_details.xml` and `item_manga_grid.xml`. Light surface in light mode, dark in dark mode.
- **Frosted app bars and cards on every art theme**: added the translucent card style and themed app bar styles to the 32 theme overlays that lacked them (all Broadsheet and Brutal variants, plus the Classic variants of Terminal, Arcade, Sakura and Totoro).
- **No more solid dark band** when the app bar lifts on scroll: `liftOnScrollColor` is now the translucent `appbar_lift_translucent` (82%).
- **Settings panels frosted** (86% opacity): setting rows, theme picker, sliders, segmented options, storage card.
- **Theme picker cards**: border now drawn above the art, in the card's own colour (2.5dp selected, faint 1dp otherwise); check mark uses the same colour.
- **Theme picker split in two rows**: "Style" (theme family) on top, "Colors" for the chosen family below. Picking a family keeps your current colour when available. New strings `theme_style_label`, `theme_colors_label` (English only).

#### Performance
- **Animated background**: static art is blurred once per size change instead of every frame; animation limited to ~24 fps; paused when battery saver is on.
- **Theme switching**: bursts of changes are merged into one activity recreation (120 ms debounce).
- **Theme picker**: card art rendered once into a bitmap; colours for all themes resolved off the main thread.
- **Build types**: `debug` and `preview` are now non-debuggable and minified (R8 + resource shrinking) like `release`. Debugger/breakpoints no longer work on those builds.

#### Behaviour
- **Default list mode is now Details** (`AppSettings`, `AppearanceSettingsFragment`).
- **List mode switch flash fixed**: reveal timeout raised from 400 ms to 2 s and item animations are disabled while the mode changes, so old grid covers are never shown in the Details layout.
- **History**: finished titles (no unread chapters and progress complete) are shown in grey (title, chapter, Continue button, progress bar, cover). Details list mode only.
- **Reader**: previous/next chapter buttons turn grey when there is no chapter in that direction (`reader_toolbar_icon_tint`).
