/**
 * Shared shape of the status bar protection scrim (main screen + manga details): a `colorSurface`
 * fade that holds strong across the bar itself and then loses its effect on the way down.
 *
 * [BAR_STOPS] are the requested strengths, spread across the top [BAR_FRACTION] of the scrim (the part
 * that covers the status bar); the rest is the tail that carries the last value down to nothing.
 *
 * Two separate things make a fade end in a visible line, and both have bitten this scrim:
 *
 * 1. **Amplitude.** A tail is only invisible if it leaves from a value close to nothing already —
 *    over half a bar height, anything above ~0.3 alpha still reads as a band no matter how smooth the
 *    curve is. So the strong part of the fade lives entirely over the status bar (where there is
 *    content to protect) and the tail is only a soft landing.
 * 2. **Curvature.** The eye picks out a *curvature* discontinuity, not just a value one, so "reaches
 *    zero smoothly" is not enough — the rate of change has to reach zero too, or a Mach band appears.
 *    Shapes that failed here: a linear ramp (constant slope into zero), a raised cosine raised to a
 *    fractional power (turns the tail into u^1.2, whose curvature goes to infinity at the bottom
 *    edge), and piecewise-*linear* interpolation between [BAR_STOPS] (a slope kink at every stop).
 *
 * So the bar section is a monotone cubic Hermite (Fritsch–Carlson tangents — smooth through the
 * control points, and guaranteed not to overshoot between them), and the tail is
 * `(1-v)³·(a + b·v)`: the cubed factor forces value, slope *and* curvature to zero at the bottom,
 * while `b` is solved so the tail leaves at exactly the slope the Hermite arrives with.
 *
 * ponytail: plain gradient, no RenderEffect blur — works on minSdk 26 and has no RenderNode/EGL
 * hazards. Evenly spaced stops because GradientDrawable's offset-aware setColors is API 29.
