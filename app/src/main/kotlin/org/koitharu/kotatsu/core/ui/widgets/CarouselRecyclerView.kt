/**
 * A horizontal carousel that always takes its width from its container, never from its content.
 *
 * A [com.google.android.material.carousel.CarouselLayoutManager] derives its keylines — and so its
 * scroll range — from the width of its container. If the RecyclerView is ever measured without an
 * exact width it auto-measures itself to its children instead, computes keylines for that width, and
 * decides everything fits: the scroll extent comes out larger than the scroll range, so it is not
 * scrollable and it re-clamps its scroll offset to the start. Worse, the row above then adopts that
 * content width as its own and hands it back as an exact spec, so the bogus width grows frame after
 * frame (observed: 2568 → 2949 → 5718 in the wide layouts, three passes per frame while dragging).
 * The carousel could never scroll, so the parent scroll view took the gesture and moved vertically
 * instead — the flicker.
 *
 * Forcing the width from the parent cuts that loop at its only entry point: the width is now the same
 * value a `match_parent` child is supposed to get, negative margins included.

/**

 * The wide (rail/landscape) layouts lay the carousel out mid-measure at transient widths before the

 * the library shift an all-anchor keyline state and throw "There must be a keyline marked as focal".
 * That pass is thrown away anyway, so it is skipped; the next pass at the real width recalculates
 * the keylines normally (the failed recalculation never assigned them).
